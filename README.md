## Highlights
- Graceful application of responsive behavior from 320px mobile screen all the way upto 2560px ultrawide screen size.
- Modern standard design of hamburger menu for tablet & mobile with no-scroll when menu is expanded.
- Impressive and consistent hero image behavior to give site a face lift.
- Sleek implementation of CTA form on  button click with hero blur effect.
- Standard card accordion behavior in mobile view for below the fold content.
- Consistent use of color and typeface to achieve a professional, clean, and uncluttered look.
- Methodical & non-intrusive behavior changes in cursor pointer, button, etc. to provide important visual cues during interaction. 
- Minimal yet effective use of subtle text shadow, box shadow and other effects.
- And many more ... 

 All of this achieved without using any external libraries or code snippets.
